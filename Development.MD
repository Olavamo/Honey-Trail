# Development Plan

### Version 1.0

## Site Detection

### Step 1

Create a URL list (100+) of major websites with <b>free-trial</b> & <b>end subscription</b>

List can be updated with <b>User Feedback</b> after review

### Step 2

Utilize <b>machine learning</b> to analyze URLs (<i>https://*/<b>study_this</b></i>) with free-trial offer

### Step 3

Use the list generated and machine learning to detect free-trial subscription page



## User Feedback
Users can alert us when program activates when it shouldn't, and where it doesn't when it should

### Case 1 - Not activated on Trial Page

Clicking on OnTheHouse icon provides user to set a reminder for the service - End of User input.

Program automatically detects 'website_name', 'trial_period'

    ex) Would you like to set a end-subscription reminder for 'website_name'?
        We will remind you in 'trial_period - 3' days. (option to change)

Program terminates after sending current URL and user input for employee review


### Case 2 - Activated when it shouldn't

Default window has option [<b>not on trial page</b>] for OnTheHouse Ver 1.0 (to be removed in Ver 2.0)

Program will also keep track of pages where user immediately clicked off-screen to close OnTheHouse. The data collected will determine feasibility of machine learning application and determine importance of [<b>not on trial page</b>] button for Ver 2.0
