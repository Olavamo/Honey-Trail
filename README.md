# Honey-Trail


## Synopsis

Chrome extension creates alert before free-trial period expires and provides option to end subscription


## Motivation

Today's consumers are easily lured into these recurring payments with the free-trial offers. Although charges do not occur until the free trial end-date, the user must manually act and cancel the subscription to avoid the charge. The Federal Trade Commission recommends that consumers mark their calendars to manually unsubscribe from the unwanted services. Yet, this task can be automated and improved with Honey-Trail
