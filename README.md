# OnTheHouse


## Synopsis

OnTheHouse is a Chrome extension that displays a reminder before user's free-trial period for an online service expires. Final version of the product will provide option to unsubscribe with a single click.


## Motivation

Online consumers are easily lured into these recurring payments with the free-trial offers. Although users are not charged until the end of the free trial period, the user must manually re-visit the website and cancel the subscription to avoid the charge. The Federal Trade Commission recommends that consumers <i>mark their calendars</i> to unsubscribe from the unwanted services. The provided solution is ineffective and can be automated. OnTheHouse is created with goals of protecting consumer rights.

## Counter Counter Argument

Free trial is a customer acquisition strategy adapted by many online service providers. Unfortunately, it exploits user's carelessness to make profit. Otherwise users would not have to enter their credit card information for the <b>free trial</b>!

## Sustainable Business Model

Users will not pay for the service.
