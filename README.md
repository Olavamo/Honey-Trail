# OnTheHouse


## Synopsis
OnTheHouse is a Chrome extension that displays a reminder before user's free-trial period expires. Final version of the product will provide option to unsubscribe from the online service with a single click. OnTheHouse is created with goals of protecting consumer rights.


## Motivation
Free trial is a customer acquisition strategy adapted by many online service providers. Unfortunately, it exploits user's carelessness to make profit. Otherwise users would not have to enter their credit card information for the <b>free trial</b>!  Online consumers are easily lured into these recurring payments with the free-trial offers. Although users are not charged until the end of the free trial period, the user must manually re-visit the website and cancel the subscription to avoid the charge. The Federal Trade Commission recommends that consumers <i>mark their calendars</i> to unsubscribe from the unwanted services. The provided solution is ineffective and can be automated.


## Service Provided
1. Reminder to unsubscribe from unwanted service
2. (Optional) Automatic unsubscribtion setting // legal risk
3. Recommend services that many users choose to continue after free trial
4. Offer alert on temporary free trial release


## Business Model
Users will not pay for the use of this service. Instead their de-personalized data may be sold for marketing studies purposes.
